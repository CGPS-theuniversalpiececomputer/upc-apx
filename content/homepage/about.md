bio: This symbol represents **the universal piece**. The emblem representing the universal piece is a symbol that combines the iconic peace sign with additional elements to convey the concept of unity and connection. At the top of the symbol, there is a 'U' shape overlaying a 'W', which is integrated into the peace sign. The 'U' stands for "universal," and its tips extend upward from the peace symbol, while the lower curve extends downward past the bottom of the peace sign. This design suggests that the universal piece is the union of all world pieces, symbolizing the inclusive and continuous process of the universal piece computer that hosts it. This symbol is trademarked, but not registered.
